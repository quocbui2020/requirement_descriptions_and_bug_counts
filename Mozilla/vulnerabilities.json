    "impact": "High",
    "description": "Kazuho Oku of Cybozu Labs reports via the Information-technology Promotion\nAgency, Japan, that Firefox is vulnerable to HTTP response smuggling when\nused with certain proxy servers.\nThe first technique takes advantage of Mozilla's lenient handling\nof HTTP header syntax which was necessary in the past to cope with various\nreal-world servers. One aspect was to accept HTTP headers with space\ncharacters between the header name and the colon. A modern proxy with strict\nsyntax checking would ignore these as invalid headers while Mozilla\nclients might accept them and interpret one long response as two shorter\nresponses. If a page on the malicious host can make Firefox issue two\nrequests in succession, one to the malicious host and one to the victim\nsite, the second part of the response from the malicious site could\nbe interpreted as the response from the victim site. The content of\nthat response could be a web page that could steal login cookies or\nother sensitive data if the user has an account at the victim site.\nA second variant accomplishes the same thing by sending HTTP 1.1\nheaders through an HTTP 1.0 proxy such as the popular Squid. The proxy\nwill ignore the unknown 1.1 header (such as \"Transfer-Encoding: chunked\")\nwhile Mozilla-based clients will accept them and again can be made to\ninterpret one long request as two shorter ones.\nIf the user is not browsing through a proxy the same attacks\ncan still be mounted but would be effective only if the malicious\nsite were at the same IP address as the victim site.\nThunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox\nand could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail.

    "description": "iDefense \nhas informed Mozilla about two potential buffer overflow\nvulnerabilities found by researcher regenrecht\nin the Network Security Services (NSS) code for processing \nthe SSLv2 protocol.\nSSL clients such as Firefox and Thunderbird can suffer\na buffer overflow if a malicious server presents a certificate\nwith a public key that is too small to encrypt the entire\n\"Master Secret\". Exploiting this overflow appears to be\nunreliable but possible if the SSLv2 protocol is enabled.\nServers that use NSS \nfor the SSLv2 protocol can be exploited by\na client that presents a \"Client Master Key\" with invalid length\nvalues in any of several fields that are used without adequate\nerror checking. This can lead to a buffer overflow that\npresumably could be exploitable.\nSupport for SSLv2 is disabled in Firefox 2 due to other known\nweaknesses in the protocol; Firefox 2 is not vulnerable unless\nthe user has modified hidden internal NSS settings to\nre-enable SSLv2 support.",

Setting the value triggers a load, but the networking software reads\nthe hostname only up to the null character while other checks for \"parent\ndomain\" start at the right and so can have a completely different idea of what\nthe current host is.\nThis cannot be used for a direct same-origin violation to perform cross-site\nscripting: those checks are performed on the complete hostname including\nthe nulls. However, other mechanisms rely on matching parent domains and those\ncan be fooled by this trick. For example, this flaw allows a malicious page\nto set domain cookies for any arbitrary site, which might be useful in a\nsession-fixation attack. This also allows setting document.domain to any\narbitrary value which could be used to perform a cross-site scripting\nattack against any page which also sets document.domain.",

Since the cookie host continued\nto be set correctly there was very little that could be done\nthat the site could not legitimately set in the first place.

The danger\ndepends on the arguments supported by the specific receiving program,\nthough at the very least we know Firefox (and Thunderbird) 2.0.0.4 and\nolder could be used to run arbitrary script (see\nMFSA 2007-23). The vast majority of programs\ndo not have dangerous arguments, though many could still be made to do\nsomething unexpected.\nA similar issue with URIs passed to external handlers was reported by\nBilly Rios and Nate McFeters. When running\nFirefox on Windows XP with IE7 installed, URIs for certain\ncommon protocols (such as mailto:) that contain a %00 do not\nlaunch the protocol handler registered for that scheme but instead launch\na file handling program based on the file extension at the end of the URI.\nCoupled with the issue reported by Jesper Johansson this appears to allow\nexecution of any program installed at a known location and limited argument\npassing that might be enough to exploit a system.\nFurther investigation by Secunia showed that a % not\nfollowed by a valid two-digit hexadecimal number also triggered the problem\nfor the affected protocols. The Firefox and Thunderbird 2.0.0.6 releases\ncontain fixes that prevent the original demonstrations of this variant, but\nit is still possible to launch a filetype handler based on extension rather\nthan the registered protocol handler. A way to exploit a common handler with\na single unexpected URI as an argument may yet be found. Since this handling\nis a property of the Windows Shell API this variant appears to affect other\ninternet-enabled applications that pass these URIs to the Windows Shell.",

    "description": "Mozilla developer John G. Myers reported a weakness in\nthe trust model used by Mozilla regarding alternate names on self-signed\ncertificates (and those with mismatched names) that if accepted could\nbe used to spoof a secure connection to any other site. This problem was\nindependently reported by Frank Benkstein and\nNils Toedtmann.\nIn Firefox 2 and earlier Mozilla-based browsers, when a user encounters a\nsite with a self-signed certificate or one whose name does not exactly match\nthe name in the certificate an error dialog is presented that allows the user\nto reject the certificate, or accept it as valid and access the site.\nThere was no concept of partial trust, accepting the certificate as valid\nmarked it as trusted for all information it contained, including alternate\nsite names. These alternate names could be viewed as part of the certificate\ndetails, but since they were not present on the initial dialog many users\ncould be fooled into accepting a certificate for a site they didn't care about\n(but wanted to see) that also asserted that it was a certificate for your bank\nor prominent online shop. Once accepted this certificate could be used to\nspoof that site or perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack.\nThe dialog has been changed in Firefox 2.0.0.15 to list the alternate\nnames and users should not accept certificates that claim an unreasonable\nset of alternate names. Certificate handling in Firefox 3 is quite different\nand it was not susceptible to this vulnerability. In Firefox 3 there is no\ndialog to accept self-signed certificates, and when users do choose to make\nan exception to the SSL security model the certificate is only trusted\nfor that one listed exception, not for any other site.",

Malicious scripts could only read\nfrom files with known names stored in the same folder (or sub-folder) as\nthe shortcut.",

    "description": "Security researcher Billy Rios reported that if Firefox\nis not already running, passing it a command-line URI with pipe (\"|\") symbols\nwill open multiple tabs. This URI splitting could be used to launch \nchrome: URIs from the command-line, a partial bypass of the fix for\nMFSA 2005-53 which was intended to\nblock external applications from loading such URIs (that vulnerability\nremains fixed, however).\nThis vulnerability could also be used by an attacker to pass URIs to\nFirefox that would normally be handled by a vector application by appending it\nto a URI not handled by the vector application. For example, web browsers\nnormally handle file: URIs themselves, or block them from web\ncontent altogether, but this flaw enabled attackers to pass them from another\nbrowser into Firefox. In Firefox 2 scripts running from file: URIs can read\ndata from a user's entire disk, a risk if the attacker could first place a\nmalicious file in a guessable location on the local disk. Rios demonstrated that\nthe so-called \"Safari Carpet-bombing vulnerability\" could be used for this,\nas well as another technique that does not rely on that now-fixed Safari\nvulnerability.\nIn Firefox 3 scripts running in local files have limited access to\nother files, almost entirely mitigating the file: attack.\nHowever, combined with a vulnerability which allows an attacker to inject\nscript into a chrome document the above issue could be used to run\narbitrary code on a victim's computer. Such a chrome injection vulnerability\nwas discovered in Firefox 3 by Mozilla developers Ben Turner\nand Dan Veditz. In the absence of the attack described\nby Billy Rios this injection attack would not run with any special privilege\nand would be at best a spoofing vulnerability.",

Many\nsupported characters are similar or identical to others in English, allowing for\nthe potential spoofing of domain names and for phishing attacks when not\nblocked.

However, it became clear that a number of\nhistorical dangerous registrations continued to be valid.\nThis issue has been fixed by removing the .com, .net, and .name top-level\ndomains from the IDN whitelist, and supplementing the whitelist implementation\nwith technical restrictions against script-mixing in domain labels.

Applications that wish to prevent copied data from being recorded in Cloud History must use specific clipboard formats; and Thunderbird before version 91.3 did not implement them. This could have caused sensitive data to be recorded to a user's Microsoft account.<br>*This bug only affects Thunderbird for Windows 10+ with Cloud Clipboard enabled.
